# PWA Boilerplate

This template provides a basic structure for creating a Progressive Web App (PWA) using vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

# Getting started
- Clone this repo and begin by editing this index.html file with your HTML content. 3 favicons have been provided, you can add your own if you want. 
- At least 1 favicon is necessary for a PWA to be installable.
- Add your CSS and JS files in the assets directory.
- The serviceworker.js file is necessary to enable installation of a PWA. It registers the scope for caching of assets.
- Edit the manifest.json file with the name and description of your project.
- On Chromium based browsers, Richer Install is supported. You can add screenshots of your web app in the manifest.json file to enable it.
