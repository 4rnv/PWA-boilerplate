    <h2>Build a Progressive Web App with vanilla HTML, CSS and Javascript</h2>
    <p>A Progressive Web App (PWA) is a web application that uses modern web capabilities to deliver an enhanced app-like experience to users. This template provides a basic structure for creating a Progressive Web App (PWA) using vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.</p>
    <p>To get started, clone this repo and begin by editing this index.html file with your HTML content. 3 favicons have been provided, you can add your own if you want. At least 1 favicon is necessary for a PWA to be installable.</p>
    <p>Add your CSS and JS files in the assets directory.</p>
    <p>The serviceworker.js file is necessary to enable installation of a PWA. It registers the scope for caching of assets.</p>
    <p>Edit the manifest.json file with the name and description of your project.</p> 
    <p>On Chromium based browsers, Richer Install is supported. You can add screenshots of your web app in the manifest.json file to enable it.</p>
    <p>If you want to learn more, Mozilla Developer Network (MDN) and web.dev are good resources.</p>
